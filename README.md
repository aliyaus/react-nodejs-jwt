# react-nodejs-jwt

a simple react+nodejs app that demonstrates user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) & httpOnlyCookies 

# key concepts 
* full stack application development (frontend & backend) 
* basic user login & session management
* creating & sending a signed JWT as an httpOnlyCookie
* using a middleware function to allow access to backend routes ONLY if valid session cookie is present

# important
you will need to run both auth-frontend & server for this application to work correctly.
